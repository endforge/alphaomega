Purpose:
    Verify the required ExtractionRecord output contract.

Tests:
    - Valid ExtractionRecord accepted.
    - Missing canonical content rejected.
    - Empty canonical content rejected.
    - Missing content hash rejected.
    - Incorrect SHA-256 length rejected.
    - Non-hexadecimal SHA-256 rejected.
